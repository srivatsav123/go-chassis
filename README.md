Go-Chassis is a Software Development Kit(SDK) for rapid development of microservices in Go
 
Go-chassis is based on [Go-Micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) A pluggable RPC framework



# Features
 - **Pluggable registrator and discovery service**: Support Service center,istio pilot and file based registry by default
 - **Dynamic Configuration framework**:  you are able to develop a service which has hot-reconfiguration  feature easily
 - **Pluggable Protocol**: You can custom your own protocol,by default support http and highway(RPC)
 - **Circuit breaker**: Protect your service in runtime or on-demand
 - **Routing management**: Able to route to different service based on weight and match rule to achieve Canary Release easily
 - **Load balancing**: Add custom strategy and filter
 - **Rate limiting**: Both client side and server side rate limiting
 - **Pluggable Cipher**: Able to custom your own cipher for AKSK and TLS certs
 - **Handler Chain**: Able to add your own code during service calling for client and server side
 - **Metrics**: Able to expose Prometheus metric API automatically and sink metrics to CSE Dashboard
 - **Tracing**: Integrate with Zipkin and namedpipe to sink tracing data
 - **Logger**: You can custom your own writer to sink log, by default support file and stdout
 - **Hot-reconfiguraion**: A lot of configuration can be reload in runtime, like loadbalancing, circuit breaker, rate limiting

# Quick Start
You can see more documentations in [here](http://go-chassis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

1. Install [go 1.8+](https://golang.org/doc/install)

2. Clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ServiceComb/go-chassis.git
```

3. Use [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to download dependencies

```sh
cd go-chassis 
glide intall
```

4. Install ServiceComb [service-center](https://github.com/ServiceComb/service-center/releases)

5. [Write your first http micro service](http://go-chassis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getstarted/writing-rest.html)



# Examples

# Communication Protocols
Go-Chassis supports two types of communication protocol.
1. Rest - REST is an approach that leverages the HTTP protocol for communication.
2. Highway - This is a high performance communication protocol originally developed by Huawei.
